INSTALL NOTES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 0. Prequisite.
			 - GNU Autoconf (not strictly required)

			 - The JMagick build scripts makes very extensive use of
				 GNU Make 3.77.

			 - A ANSI C compiler. The GNU or EGCS compiler is recommended.

			 - ImageMagick developers libraries (libmagick-dev)
				 See in Changelog.txt which version is supported

			 - ImageMagick dependencies
				NOTE: If you compile IM yourself, remember to f.ex. install libtiff-dev to get TIFF support.
				On Ubuntu Linux 9.10, this commant would install TIFF and CMS support:
				> sudo apt-get install liblcms-dev libtiff4-dev libbz2-dev
				remember to install these _before_ you issue the ./configure command for ImageMagick


			 - A Java2 JDK. JMagick was developed with Sun JDK 1.4.1.

 1. Unpack the JMagick tar file.

				> tar xvfz JMagick-5.5.7-X.tar.gz

 2. Make the JMagick distribution directory current.

				> cd JMagick-5.5.7-X

 3. Not strictly required, but you might want to run autoconf:

				> autoconf

 4. Make sure that java, javac, jar, gcc are in your path.
		Run the configuration script.

				> ./configure

		The configuration script has the following options:

				--prefix=<path>
						The root path where the installation goes. For example,
						 to install the libraries into /usr/local/jmagick/lib,
						 use --prefix=/usr/local/jmagick

				--with-magick-home=<path>
						Use this if your have ImageMagick install in non-standard places.
						E.g. ./configure --with-magick-home=/usr/local/ImageMagick

				--with-java-home=<path>
						Use this to specify where your JDK is installed. This is NOT
						necessary if you have the JAVA_HOME environment set.
						E.g. ./configure --with-java-home=/usr/local/java

				--with-java-includes=<path>
						Use this to specify a Java include directory.

				--with-jikes
						If you wish to use the IBM Jikes compiler instead

				--enable-diagnostic
						If you want verbose messages. Only a few messages are available
						at the moment.

				--with-javadoc-dir=<path>
						To specify a directory path for the javadoc.

		 For example:
				> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-java-home=/usr/local/jdk1.4 --enable-diagnostic


 5. Then make everything.

			 > make all

 6. To install the binaries run:

			> make install

 7. To use JMagick, libJMagick.so must be in a directory where the
		runtime loader can find it or you must set the environment variable
		LD_LIBRARY_PATH. jmagick.jar must be in your Java class path.

 8. Examples and some simple tests can be found in test/magicktest. Simply:

			 > make simpletest

		For a more rigorous JUnit test, make sure to copy/link junit.jar to lib/
		and run:

			 > make test


 9. To generate Javadoc documentation in HTML, run:

			 > make javadoc

10. Enjoy. Subscribe to the mailing list for help and bug reports.


NOTES
~~~~~

 1. If you pulled the source from the SVN server, the make might failed
		the first time you run it because GNU Make fails inference rules
		when directories are not created yet. Try running make after the
		failure.


HINT FOR BUILD IN DEBIAN/UBUNTU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For building under Debian 16, targeting ImageMagick 6 (provided patch #73 is applied):

    sudo apt install build-essential libmagickcore-dev libmagickwand-dev imagemagick default-jdk
    autoreconf -i
    export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
    ./configure --with-magickwand-config=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ImageMagick-6.*/bin-q16/Wand-config
    make all
